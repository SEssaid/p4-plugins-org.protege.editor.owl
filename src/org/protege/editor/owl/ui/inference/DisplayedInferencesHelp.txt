These preferences control what inferences are displayed while
navigating around in Protege.  Each type of inference includes an
estimate of the total time that Protege has spent doing that
inference.  These times are dynamically updated as different owl
entities are selected and inference mechanisms are invoked.  Thus if
navigating a tab is becoming expensive and you believe that the
automatic inferences may be the culprit, then you can come to this
preferences panel to determine which inferences are causing the delay.
