 * A custom URIMapper.  This is used by the various parsers to
 * convert ontology URIs into physical URIs that point to concrete
 * representations of ontologies.
 * <p/>
 * The mapper uses the following strategy:
 * <p/>
 * It looks in auto-mapped libraries.  These are folder libraries
 * that correspond to folders where the "root ontologies" have been
 * loaded from.  If the mapper finds an ontology that has a mapping
 * to one of these auto-mapped files, then the URI of the
 * auto-mapped file is returned.
