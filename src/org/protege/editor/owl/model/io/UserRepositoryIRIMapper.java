 * convert ontology URIs into physical URIs that point to concrete
 * representations of ontologies.
 * <p/>
 * The mapper uses the following strategy:
 * <p/>
 * It looks in the ontology libraries.  If an ontology library
 * contains an ontology that has the logical URI then the library
 * is asked for the physical URI and this URI is returned.
