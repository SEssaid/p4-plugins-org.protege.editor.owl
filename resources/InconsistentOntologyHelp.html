Your ontology is inconsistent which means that the OWL reasoner will
no longer be able to provide any useful information about the
ontology.  
<p>
You have several options at this point:
<ul>
<li> If you think you know what the problem is then you can try to fix the
  ontology without any extra help.  If you fix the ontology and
  synchronize the reasoner it will become useful again.</li>
<li> You can try the Protege explanation facility.  It is in an early
  phase and cannot explain all problems.  In the future other
  explanation plugins may become available that can solve a wider
  variety of problems.</li>
<li> Some reaoners come with command line tools that will provide a
  complete explanation for inconsistent ontologies.</li>
</ul>
