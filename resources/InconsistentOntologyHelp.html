Your ontology is inconsistent which means that the OWL reasoner will
no longer be able to provide any useful information about the
ontology.  
<p>
Protege can try to help - the Protege developers have
developed some heuristics that will hopefully help debug the most
common causes of an inconsistent ontology. By clicking the "explain"
button below you will start the Protege explanation process.  In
addition, some reasoners (e.g. pellet) come with command line tools
that can help debug problems with inconsistent ontologies.
